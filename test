-1: Define available drinks and options.
-This dictionary holds the possible drinks and whether they have add-ons available.
available_drinks = {
    "coffee": ["milk", "sugar"],  - When choosing coffee it can have milk and sugar
    "tea": ["lemon", "honey"],    - Choices for tea are lemon and honey
    "water": []                  - Water doesn't have any add-ons
}

-2: Asking the customer what drink they’d want.
print("Welcome to the Drink Ordering System!")

-Ask the customer to choose a drink
drink = input("Please choose a drink: Coffee, Tea, or Water: ").lower()  - `.lower()` ensures that it doesn’t have to be case sensitive

-Make sure that the customer’s input is valid. If it isn’t, it prints an error message and exits.
if drink not in available_drinks:
    print("Invalid drink choice.")
    exit()  - Exit the program if an invalid drink is selected.

-3: Ask for add-ons based on the selected drink.
For Coffee, the user can select Milk and/or Sugar.
For Tea, the user can select Lemon and/or Honey.
Water has no options for add-ons.

-Initialize an empty list to store add-ons.
add_ons = []

-Ask for add-ons if the customer selected Coffee.
if drink == "coffee":
    - Prompt for milk.
    milk = input("Do you want milk? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if milk == "yes":
        add_ons.append("milk")  - Adds "milk" to the list of add ons.
    
    - Prompt for sugar.
    sugar = input("Do you want sugar? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if sugar == "yes":
        add_ons.append("sugar")  - Adds "sugar" to the list of add ons.

-Ask for add-ons if the customer selected Tea.
elif drink == "tea":
    # Prompt for lemon.
    lemon = input("Do you want lemon? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if lemon == "yes":
        add_ons.append("lemon")  - Adds "lemon" to the list of add ons.
    
    - Prompt for honey.
    honey = input("Do you want honey? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if honey == "yes":
        add_ons.append("honey")  - Adds "honey" to the list of add ons.

- No need for add-ons if the user selected Water, so this is skipped.

-4: Display the final order summary.
-The program now constructs a summary of the customer’s order based on the selections.

-Begin forming the order message.
order_message = f"Your drink selection: {drink.capitalize()}"  - Capitalize the drink name for neatness.

-Add add-ons to the order message.
if add_ons:
    order_message += " with " + " and ".join(add_ons)  - Join multiple add-ons with "and".

-5: Display the completed order.
print(order_message)
