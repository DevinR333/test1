# This program simulates a drink ordering system. The user selects a drink,
# specifies any additions (milk, sugar, lemon, honey), and receives a formatted order summary.

# Step 1: Define available drinks and options.
# This dictionary holds the possible drinks and whether they have add-ons available.
available_drinks = {
    "coffee": ["milk", "sugar"],  # Coffee can have milk and sugar
    "tea": ["lemon", "honey"],    # Tea can have lemon and honey
    "water": []                  # Water doesn't have any add-ons
}

# Step 2: Greet the user and ask for their drink choice.
print("Welcome to the Drink Ordering System!")

# Prompt the user to choose a drink from the available options.
drink = input("Please choose a drink: Coffee, Tea, or Water: ").lower()  # `.lower()` ensures case-insensitivity.

# Check if the user input is valid. If not, print an error message and exit.
if drink not in available_drinks:
    print("Invalid drink choice.")
    exit()  # Exit the program if an invalid drink is selected.

# Step 3: Ask for add-ons based on the selected drink.
# For Coffee, the user can select Milk and/or Sugar.
# For Tea, the user can select Lemon and/or Honey.
# Water has no options for add-ons.

# Initialize an empty list to store add-ons.
add_ons = []

# Ask for add-ons if the user selected Coffee.
if drink == "coffee":
    # Prompt for milk.
    milk = input("Do you want milk? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if milk == "yes":
        add_ons.append("milk")  # Add "milk" to the list of add-ons.
    
    # Prompt for sugar.
    sugar = input("Do you want sugar? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if sugar == "yes":
        add_ons.append("sugar")  # Add "sugar" to the list of add-ons.

# Ask for add-ons if the user selected Tea.
elif drink == "tea":
    # Prompt for lemon.
    lemon = input("Do you want lemon? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if lemon == "yes":
        add_ons.append("lemon")  # Add "lemon" to the list of add-ons.
    
    # Prompt for honey.
    honey = input("Do you want honey? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if honey == "yes":
        add_ons.append("honey")  # Add "honey" to the list of add-ons.

# No need for add-ons if the user selected Water, so skip this section.

# Step 4: Display the final order summary.
# The program now constructs a summary of the user's order based on the selections.

# Begin forming the order message.
order_message = f"Your drink selection: {drink.capitalize()}"  # Capitalize the drink name for neatness.

# Add add-ons to the order message.
if add_ons:
    order_message += " with " + " and ".join(add_ons)  # Join multiple add-ons with "and".

# Step 5: Display the completed order.
print(order_message)

# The program ends here.
